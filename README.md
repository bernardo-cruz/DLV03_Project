# Introduction
The objective of this project is to recognize arabic letters using a CNN model and create artistic pictures with a Neural Style Transfer Model. The predicted arabic letter indicates which style is used (i.e. Picasso, Van Gogh etc.) to create a picture with the Neural Style Transfer Model.

## Models
- **CNN**  
  A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.

- **Neural Style Transfer**  
  Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.
